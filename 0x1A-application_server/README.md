## 0x1A-application_server

This application server is an example of how to implement a simple web application server using the `socket` module in Python. It will respond to GET requests for the path `/hello` with the text `Hello World!`.


It is a very simple application, so there is not much to see. Please take a look at the [source code](server.py) to see how it works.
